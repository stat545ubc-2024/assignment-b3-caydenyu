# SteamGames App

## Description
This repository contains the SteamGames app. It uses the 'steam_games' dataset from the 'datateachr' package. This app allows users to explore the games offered in the Steam library. The 3 main features include a slider, checkboxes, and an interactive table. The slider allows the user to specify a price range so they only see games within their budget. The checkboxes allow the user to specify which genre(s) they are interested in, enabling additional filtering. The interactive table itself contains many smaller features, including the ability to select how many items are displayed at a time, the ability to search for a specific title, and the ability to sort each column by ascending/descending order.
